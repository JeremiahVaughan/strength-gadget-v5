I can use the redis hash set to keep track of current step and updated
values for each exercise measurement. At the end of each superset I can
save updated measurement values.

# daily_workouts are created each day. They expire after 36 hours (should they fail to replace this should trigger health check failure)
daily_workout hash composition:
- lower json string
- core json string
- upper json string

user workout hash composition:
- current_step_pointer.
- workout_routine

user updated measurement values hash composition:
- updated exercise measurement values

# Exercises slotted
user exercises selection sorted set values
- exercise selection values



client calls
- getCurrentWorkout
- selectStep
- replaceStep
- completeStep/repeatCompletionStep #repeat completions are just pointers to the corresponding completion step. This makes selection easier because I don't have to update multiple of the same steps
    - increment/decrement measurement type
