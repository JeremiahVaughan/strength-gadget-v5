Strength Gadget is designed to make you strong.

One of the biggest indicators of how strong you are is how consistently you exercise. Strength Gadget is designed around the idea of keeping you working out as consistently as possible.

We accomplish this be reducing the barriers to start your exercises by getting rid of road blocks like:
 - what exercises should I do
 - what weight did I do last time
 - should I count reps, or just perform the exercise for a set amount of time.
 - how do I perform the exercise
 - what warm ups should I do
 - how should I stretch out afterwards

 Even though this sounds like a lot to worry about, the app itself is meant to be extremely simple to interact with. There are no surveys to gauge your preferences or training programs to target specific goals. Instead the app just gets you busy moving your body. Weather you want to lose weight, build endurance, or lift heavier metal, it doesn't matter. The bottom line is that good things will happen as long as you are consistent. You might even end up in a situation where you thought you just wanted to simply lose weight but after putting on more muscle you realize that getting strong too feels pretty damn good.
